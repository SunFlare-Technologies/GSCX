## Overview

The Core system provides the foundational layer for PS3 system emulation, implementing:

### Low-Level Emulation (LLE)
- Pure assembly implementations for critical system functions
- Direct hardware register manipulation
- Real-time system response requirements
- Maximum compatibility with original PS3 firmware

### Virtualization Architecture
- Software-based SYSCON emulation replacing firmware interception
- Virtual hardware interfaces for seamless integration
- Modular design for maintainability and extensibility
- Backward compatibility with existing software stack

### Performance Optimization
- Memory-efficient C++ implementations
- Optimized assembly routines for critical paths
- Clean separation of concerns between components
- Production-ready error handling and recovery

## Integration Points

The Core system integrates with:
- **Bootloader**: Multi-stage boot sequence management
- **Recovery**: Hardware diagnostics and recovery procedures  
- **API**: High-level interface for application interaction
- **Scripting**: Lua-based automation and testing framework

## Development Guidelines

- Follow modular architecture principles
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Document all assembly functions and interfaces
- Maintain compatibility with PS3 hardware specifications
- Ensure thread-safe operations where applicable
